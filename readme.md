# TinyPulse Word Cloud Tool

This tool can be used to generate a suitable output for word cloud generation based on the value of `Text Response` fields in the TinyPulse survey results report. The process works by parsing CSV files, generated by TinyPulse, to produce an output that filters common words (i.e. `and`, `the`, etc.).
